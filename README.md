This project is part of my **Data Science & Analytics Internship at Future Interns**.  
The objective was to analyze Facebook/Instagram ad campaign data to evaluate campaign performance using KPIs like CTR, CPC, Conversions, and ROI.

## 🧠 Objective

To track and evaluate the effectiveness of social media marketing campaigns using:
- Campaign performance metrics (Impressions, Clicks, Spend)
- Engagement and conversion analysis

- Visual storytelling through dashboards

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI** – for data modeling and interactive dashboards  
- **DAX** – to calculate custom metrics like CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate  
- **CSV Dataset** – Facebook ad campaign data (`data (2).csv`)

## 📈 Key Metrics Calculated

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| **CTR (%)** | `(Clicks / Impressions) * 100` |
| **CPC** | `Spend / Clicks` |
| **Conversion Rate (%)** | `(Total Conversions / Clicks) * 100` |
| **Approved Conversions** | Sum of `approved_conversion` |
| **Spend** | Total ad spend in currency |

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **CTR by Age & Gender**

## 💡 Key Insights

- Interest groups **28 and 33** had better conversion rates than others.
- Some campaigns had high spend but low conversion – need optimization.
